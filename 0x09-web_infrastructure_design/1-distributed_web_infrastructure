Positive and negative notes on the server:
1. The image displays the use of a load balancer for an active set up
2. It distributes trafic between the servers
3. There is even distribution of load between web server(server) and application server
4. That provides redundancy in case one server becomes unavailable. 
5. The load balancer therefore improves the overall performance, scalability, and availability of the web infrastructure.
6. MYSQL sychronizes data through replication
7. There is no monitoring of data available and traffic is kept unecrypted
8. The servers has no firewall protection 
9. SPOF: the load balance has a SIngle Point of Failure
10. The datadase takes both read and write comands while the replica made by MYSQL can only take read
